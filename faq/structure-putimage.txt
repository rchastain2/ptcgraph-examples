The structure, used by putimage is as follows:

3 longints (12 bytes):
- image width
- image height
- reserved

followed by width*height 16-bit words. If you're a using a 16-bit color
mode (that's the highest supported - it's a limitation of the graph unit
include files, which ptcgraph reuses from the fpc sources), the color
format is rgb565.
